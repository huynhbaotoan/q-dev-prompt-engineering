# Troubleshooting Common Issues

## Vague or Irrelevant Responses

**Problem**: Amazon Q provides generic or off-topic responses.  
**Solution**: Add more specific details to your prompt, include relevant context using @file or @folder, and clearly state your expectations.

## Incomplete Code Solutions

**Problem**: Generated code is incomplete or doesn't address all requirements.  
**Solution**: Break down complex requests into smaller, more manageable parts. Specify all requirements clearly and use iterative refinement.

## Context Limitations

**Problem**: Amazon Q doesn't seem to understand the full context of your project.  
**Solution**: Use @workspace to provide broader context, or explicitly include the most relevant files using @file notation.

## Mode-Specific Limitations

**Problem**: Amazon Q can't perform certain actions.  
**Solution**: Ensure you're in the appropriate mode (read-only vs. pair-programming) for your task. Use the IDE Chat toggle to switch between modes if necessary.
